        <p class="petitionP">For just a moment, think about your social media. Think about everything you post or have on your phone. How would you feel if one day your information was leaked such as your date of birth, address, contact information. Mistakes like this can be detrimental to anyone and a serious cause for concern. It's time that large apps and technology companies such as Meta, Instagram, and Twitter begin to start taking data privacy much more seriously. It's hurting us users and if you want to help us spread awareness to this issue, please sign our petition.</p>
